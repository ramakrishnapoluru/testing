# Instructions on running the code:

The best performing model in the inflation prediction (CPI Index) is obtained through the ARIMA 
model. 

# Here the steps to run the models: 

Step 1: Download the folder ARIMA_Project from the code 
 
Step 2: The path for the input dataset in main.py should be changed to the path in the code folder.

Step 3: Open the terminal and execute the main.py file of the ARIMA_Project folder

Step 4: Post execution 5 months results of the CPI index will be loaded into the file named ouput_results.

Fetch the data either through manual download of the economic indicators or through API’s: 


1. Month: The month and year for the data point, formatted as YYYY-MM-DD.

2. Unemployment Rate: The percentage of the labor force that is unemployed.

3. Personal Saving Rate: The percentage of people's income remaining each month after taxes and spending.

4. M2: A measure of the money supply that includes cash, checking deposits, and easily convertible near money.

5. Real Disposable Personal Income: The amount of money that households have available for spending and saving after income taxes have been accounted for, adjusted for inflation.

6. Personal Consumption Expenditures: The value of the goods and services purchased by, or on the behalf of, U.S. residents.

7. Real Broad Effective Exchange Rate: An index that tracks the value of a country's currency against a basket of other major currencies, adjusted for inflation.

8. Market Yield on U.S. Treasury Securities at 10-Year Constant Maturity: The yield or interest rate of U.S. Treasury securities with a 10-year maturity.

9. Federal Funds Effective Rate: The interest rate at which depository institutions lend reserve balances to other depository institutions overnight.

10. Total Construction Spending: The total spending on construction projects.

11. Industrial Production: Total Index: An index measuring the output of the industrial sector of the economy.

12. Core Consumer Price Index: An index that measures changes in the price of goods and services, excluding food and energy, which can fluctuate widely.
